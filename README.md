# thesis-tex
LaTeX class files (plus barebones working example) of a LaTeX thesis document for a University of Wisconsin--Madison PhD dissertation.

## thesis.cls
This is what you should add to your document as `\documentclass[12pt]{thesis}`.

## thesis.bst
This is the Natbib style file for the BibTeX bibliography (`\bibliographystyle{thesis}`).

## thesis\_aasms.sty
AASTeX addons for thesis.cls, to make sure all the niceties you're used to from `emulateapj` are still around.
